1.
Open code folder (you can copy and paste all the .py files in the code folder into the testing ressources folder)

2. for other tests:
Run the crawl, you can call crawl(seed) in crawler.py -> the seed is the url you want to crawl.

3. (can only run after crawl has been run)
You can call any functions in the searchdata.py -> ex. get get_outgoing_links(URL)
You can call search(phrase, boost) in search.py
